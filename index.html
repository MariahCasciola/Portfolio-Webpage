          <div>
            My name is Mariah and I am a software engineer, I never knew what I
            wanted to do with my life, until I fell in love with software
            enginneering.

            The truth is, I began programming on a whim. I had grown fatigued
            from waiting tables and bagging groceries, and needed a way to
            change my life.
          </div>
          <div>
            I enrolled into a software engineering bootcamp called Thinkful on
            November 14th, 2023.

            <li>
              Since graduating Thinkful, my goal has been to become a front-end
              developer. I love React, CSS, and Bootstrap, and I believe my
              artistic talent can shine through in web design.
            </li>
            <li>
              On my own time, I enjoy drawing in ink, and painting with acrylic
              on canvas. I have always been very attentive to the detail of my
              art, and I think this translates very well into being a front-end
              developer. At heart I am a creator, and my software is my art.
