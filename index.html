      <p class="wrapper">
        My name is Mariah Casciola, not Mariah Carey, and I am an up and coming
        software developer from Houston, TX. I can sing like a star, but I can't
        dance like one.

        <div class="wrapper">
          <ul>
            <li>
              On my own time I enjoy experimenting with makeup and watching
              movies.
            </li>
            <li>
              My favorite genre is psychological horror, and is very much a muse
              for my art.
            </li>
            <li>
              I am very new to programming, and I am excited to learn mark up
              languages for my carrer!
            </li>
            <li>
              My goal after Thinkful, is to become a front end developer or a
              UIX professional.
