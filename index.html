      <h2 class="">About Me</h2>
      <p class="">
        My name is Mariah and I am a software engineer,  I never
        knew what I wanted to do with my life, until I fell in love with software enginneering. The truth is, I began programming on a whim. I had grown fatigued from waiting tables and bagging groceries, and needed a way to change my life.

            <li>
              Since graduating Thinkful, my goal is to become a front end
              developer.
            </li>
            <li>
              On my own time I enjoy drawing in ink and painting with acrylic on
              canvas. I have always been very attentive to the detail of my art,
              and I think this translates very well into being a front-end
              developer. At heart I am a creator, and my software is my art.
