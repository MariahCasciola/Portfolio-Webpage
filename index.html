        <div>
          <p>
            My name is Mariah and I am a software engineer, I never knew what I
            wanted to do with my life, until I fell in love with software
            enginneering.
          </p>
          <p>
            The truth is, I began programming on a whim. I had grown fatigued
            from waiting tables and bagging groceries, and needed a way to
            change my life.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enrolled into a software engineering bootcamp called Thinkful on
            November 14th, 2022, and graduated on April 15th, 2023.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Since graduating Thinkful, my goal has been to become a front-end
            developer. I love React, CSS, and Bootstrap, and I believe my
            artistic talent can shine through in web design.
          </p>
          <p>
            On my own time, I enjoy drawing in ink, and painting with acrylic on
            canvas. I have always been very attentive to the detail of my art,
            and I think this translates very well into being a front-end
            developer. At heart I am a creator, and my software is my art.

            Created a REST API and middleware functions to allow users to
            create, read, update, and delete reservations and update occupied
            tables to be finished upon a guest's departure. This API is paired
            with front-ent that allowed users to interface with the API

              React app that allows users to create decks, and cards. At the

              in development for this project.
